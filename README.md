his project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin cancer types using the ISIC dataset containing 2,357 dermatoscopic images. The model detects various skin lesions including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and others. It includes training, evaluation, and prediction scripts with performance visualizations. A detailed research paper and project report are provided. The goal is to support early and accurate skin cancer diagnosis using Machine learning.
